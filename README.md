# Cox Automotive Programming Challenge

This is the solution to the Cox Automotive API programming challenge using JavaScript. Please read below for instructions on how to run the program.

## Running the Program

This project assumes you have Node.js/NPM installed on your system.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - I'd recommend installing the LTS version for your OS

I'm using [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for HTTP requests, so `node_modules` will need to be installed.

Once installed, you will need to install Node.js modules by executing this command:

```
npm install
```

Then, simply run the `answer.js` program via:

```
node answer.js
```

Happy interviewing!
